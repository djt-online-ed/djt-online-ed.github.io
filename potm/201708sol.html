	<table><tr><td>
	<b>Solution:</b><br>
		There are initially \( 2^8 \) = 256 possible tiles. Most of these will be rotations of each other, but some will have less rotationally symmetric partners.<br>
		There are 4 tiles which have 90 degree symmetry and thus no partners;<br>
		and there are 6 tiles which have 180 degree symmetry, and thus come in twos. (See image)<br>
		<img src = "201708sol.png" style = "width:50%;"><br>
		The rest will come in fours.<br><br>
		
		Split the 256 tiles along these symmetries:<br>
		4 + 12 + 240<br>
		And divide each total by its number of partners:<br>
		4 + 6 + 60<br>
		For a total of 70 distinct tiles.<br><br>
		
		(These tiles form the basis for the solitaire tile game Izzi.)
