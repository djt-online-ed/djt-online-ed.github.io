# Graphing guides

## Graphing game: Bugzapper

This game is based on a computer game called Green Globs. Whatever math class you're in, you can play this game to practice graphing all kinds of equations. [Click here to go to the Bugzapper game on Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/grza6tqcqm)

## How to use Desmos and similar

Mathvault's [Desmos: A definitive guide on graphing and computing](https://mathvault.ca/desmos-guide/) is a great introduction to using Desmos. I often use Desmos, Geogebra, and other applications in class to demonstrate, so here is a reference for myself and for you to play with it, organized by corresponding class textbook and chapter. Links to specific visualizations are (c) their respective creators.

## Trigonometry (Larson, 11th edition)

### Chapter 3

Desmos doesn't yet have vectors built-in, but Geogebra does. The commands in this chapter are for Geogebra. https://www.geogebra.org/graphing

**Vector:** Vector(point as ordered pair). For instance, `Vector((1,2))`. By default, vectors are in standard position (Initial point = (0,0)). Click and drag the arrowhead to change the vector's terminal point.

**Vector:** Vector((ordered pair), (ordered pair)) will draw a vector with the given points as initial and terminal points respectively. For instance, `Vector((1,2),(3,4))`.

**Vector operations:** If Geogebra names the vectors a and b (it doesn't boldface them), enter in the rows things like `a+b`, `a-b`, `2a+3b`, or `a*b`. Drag vectors a and b to see how it affects the other operations.

### Chapter 4

Desmos doesn't yet have complex numbers built-in, but Geogebra does. The commands in this chapter are for Geogebra. https://www.geogebra.org/graphing

**Complex number:** In a new row, enter a number in a+bi form. For instance, `2+3i`. The default label for this number is $z_1$, which you can refer to by typing `z_1`. You can define its label by entering, for instance, `w = 2+3i`. You can click and drag the point in the plane to reposition it.

**Complex color plots:** [By David Bau. Hover in the upper left for instructions.](http://davidbau.com/conformal/#z) If the original is down for any reason, [I mirrored it here.](./complex/index.html)

## Calculus (Stewart, Clegg and Watson, 9th edition)

### Chapter 1

**Restricted domain:** Enter a function followed by { condition }. For instance, `y = x^2 {-2 < x < 4}`

**Piecewise functions:** Enter y = {condition1 : definition1, condition2 : definition2, ...} For instance, `y = {x<0: 1-x, x>0: x^2-1}`

**Epsilon-Delta Limits:** https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ccc0m7bgas by me

### Chapter 2

**Derivative:** Define a function like `f(x) = x^2`. Then in another row, type `f'(x)` to see its derivative. Desmos also recognizes `d/dx (f(x))`.

**Derivative intuition:** https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fzjicbxmtr

**Implicit curves:** In any row, enter any equation in x and y and watch the fireworks. Examples to try: 
`1 = (x^2-1)(y^2-2)(x^2-3)(y^2-4)`
`sin(x) + sin(y) = sin(xy)`

### Chapter 4

**Riemann Sums:** https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cxsfmpvf69 (Set c = 1/2 for a midpoint estimate)

**Definite Integral:** Define a function like `f(x) = x^2`. Then in another row, type `int` to create the integral symbol. Use the arrow keys to select the lower endpoint. Type a number there. Use the arrow keys to select the upper endpoint. Type a number there. Use the arrow keys to put the cursor just to the right of the integral sign, and type `f(t) dt`. You can replace either endpoint with a variable and make a slider when prompted to see how changing the endpoints affects the value.

### Chapter 5

**Solids of revolution about x-axis:** https://www.desmos.com/3d/p7vx5q81i9 by me

**Solids of revolution about y-axis:** https://www.desmos.com/calculator/wakzxtsxwb

### Chapter 7

**Simpson's and other estimates:** https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ihj2dtanr2 (Simpson's rule code by unknown, the rest by me)

### Chapter 9

**Slope field generator:** https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tmi3vk4r84

### Chapter 10

**Parametric curves:** Enter $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ as an ordered pair. For instance, to graph $x(t) = \sin(4t)$ and $y(t) = \cos(5t)$, enter in a row `(sin(4t), cos(5t))`. Choose endpoints for $t$ to see more of the graph.

**Parametric trace:** To see a point trace out the parametric curve mentioned above, enter:

`f(t) = sin(4t)`

`g(t) = cos(5t)`

`(f(t), g(t))` displays the whole curve.

`(f(T), g(T))` plots a point. Create a slider for T when prompted. Drag the slider for T to move the point along the curve.

**Polar point:** Desmos always plots ordered pairs as $(x,y)$ Cartesian. To plot a polar point $(r, \theta)$, first enter `R = 0` and `T = 0` and create sliders when prompted. Then enter `(R cos T, R sin T)` to plot the polar point.

**Polar curves:** Desmos has a built-in ability to plot polar curves of the form $r = f( \theta )$. Just enter something like `r = theta/4`.

**Polar graph trace:** Follow the instructions for polar point and polar curves, except define R in terms of T according to the curve. For instance, instead of R = 0, enter R = T/4. Move the slider for T to trace the point along the polar curve.

### Chapter 11

**Sequences and series:** https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nsuoj2xxed by me

### Chapter 12

In https://www.desmos.com/3d :

**Point:** Enter as an ordered triple. For instance, `(1,2,3)`

**Line:** (Ordered triple) + (Ordered triple) t. For instance, `(1,2,3) + (4,5,6)t`

**Line:** An ordered triple made of functions of t: (f(t), g(t), h(t)). For instance, `(1+t, -2t, 3)`.

**Line:** Symmetric equations in x,y,z. For instance, `(x-1)/5 = (y+2)/4 = z/3`

**Vector:** vector(initial point, terminal point). For instance, `vector((1,2,3),(4,5,0))` .

**Plane:** Linear equation in x,y,z. For instance, `5x-4y+3z=2`

### Chapter 13

In Desmos 3D: https://www.desmos.com/3d

**Vector function:** Desmos interprets `<>` as inequality signs, not angle brackets. Enter as an ordered triple of functions of t surrounded by parentheses. For instance, `(2t+1, e^t, 1/t)`. 

**Vector function trace:** In the above, enter c as the upper bound of t and create a slider for c when prompted. Drag or animate the slider for c to draw the curve.

**Vector function trace point:** Enter in a new row the vector function as above, but with capital T in place of every t. Create a slider for T when prompted. Drag (or animate) the slider for T to move the point along the curve. (Note this will conflict with the unit tangent T(t) if you use this in the same graph.)
