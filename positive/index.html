<h2>How to talk to yourself</h2>

Shad Helmstetter, Ph.D., says in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-When-Talk-Your-Self/dp/1501171992">What to say when you talk to yourself</a> that "The brain simply believes what you tell it most. And what you tell it about you, it will create." So why do we continually say negative things to ourselves, and set ourselves up for failure? Much of it comes from our conditioning by others, but with intentional effort we can overcome the habit of negative self-talk by replacing it with positive self-talk -- and it works. Positive self-talk reprograms your subconscious brain and turns you into the person you tell it to be.<br><br>

Instead of: I'm not a math person.<br>
Replace with: <a href="./mathperson.jpg">I am a math person.</a><br><br>

Instead of: I don't know.<br>
Replace with: I may not know everything, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC82Il2cjqA">I can learn anything.</a><br>
I excelled in math from an early age and I was given more challenging material as a result. But in spite of that, I still fell victim to the same trap that affected my peers: <i>I believed that one could only be good at what they were good at "naturally"</i>. To this day, this mentality persists and it's an obstacle to me trying and learning new things. The truth is that nobody is naturally good at anything. And if we gave up everything we couldn't do naturally, we would do nothing at all.<br><br>

Instead of: I won't be able to remember this.<br>
Replace with: My brain is built for whole libraries of memory. There is plenty of room for all the math I need to remember.<br><br>

Don't underestimate the brain! It's immensely powerful. It can remember jingles from 40 years ago and entire sports team rosters. Once information is truly learned, it's permanent. (It's true that test anxiety can cause students to "forget" at the time, but it's not true forgetting. It's a disadvantage to the timed test which unfortunately is hard to work around.)<br><br>

These are just some starting phrases. Feel free to create your own. Every time you feel like saying a negative phrase, say the positive version out loud instead. It will seem corny at first, maybe even dishonest. But the key is that each of the positive statements are in the present tense. No matter what your past looked like, your present is in your control.

<h2>Learning from mistakes with ERIC</h2>

E - EXPECT mistakes. We all make them. You don't need to get everything right the first time.<br>
R - RESPECT mistakes. Do not judge one another. I will enforce this.<br>
I - INSPECT mistakes. Look over your work and figure out where the mistake is.<br>
C - CORRECT mistakes. Fix it! You will be less likely to make the same mistake again.<br><br>


<h2>Big math lessons</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you don't know something, look it up in the book. You can always rely on definitions.
<li>One aim of mathematics is a consistent system of laws. Do all rules work together?
<li>Math can be an experimental science. Can we multiply rectangles? What would that look like?
<li>All math can be visualized. Nothing is so abstract that we cannot create a picture of it.
<li>The best mathematicians are lazy. Always look for the easiest correct method.
<li>Mathematics DOES make sense. The biggest obstacle is mathematical notation which, much like the English language, is a hot mess, thrown together over many centuries. But once you get past the symbols and see the concepts, you will see unity and beauty.
</ul>


<h2>Quotes</h2>

"Mathematics is a process of staring hard enough with enough perseverance at the fog of muddle and confusion to eventually break through to improved clarity."<br>
– Bill Thurston<br><br>

"When I'm working with new students, I've often heard them say, 'I’m just not good at math!' Many people believe their intelligence is 'fixed' and they'll never be able to improve.
But research has revealed that students who develop a 'growth' mindset, recognizing that they can develop their abilities through hard work and dedication, have greater motivation and success than students who believe that intelligence is 'fixed.'"<br>
-Nidhi Reddy, Khan Academy<br><br>

"The relationship between success and IQ works only up to a point. Once someone has reached an IQ of somewhere around 120 [Can graduate from an accredited four-year college with grades that would qualify for admission to a professional or graduate school], having additional IQ points doesn't seem to translate into any measurable real-world advantage."<br>
-Malcolm Gladwell, Outliers<br><br>

[The point of the above quote is, by simply attending college, you are in the highest or next-highest effective bracket of intelligence, and therefore have the best capacity of passing math or other classes, whether you feel that way or not.]<br><br>


<h2>Problem solving</h2>

"Word problems", "Story problems", etc, are all Problem Solving, which is an essential skill in life. Life is full of problems, and mathematics is designed to solve some of them. How should I design a soup can so that it holds as much as possible? How fast is my internet connection? What follows are some general tips for problem solving.<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Relax. You've done this before.
<li>Draw a picture. This is primarily for physical situations but can also help for abstract ones.
<li>Whatever unknown the problem asks for, label it with a variable. Also, label any other important values.
<li>Come up with as many mathematical facts as you can relating the variables and givens.
<li>Combine these facts.
<li>The current section gives you new tools! Use them.
<li>However, don't just learn how to use the tool, learn when that new tool is or isn't necessary. A hammer is good for some tasks, but not for turning a screw OR replacing a light bulb.
<li>Check your answer mathematically and logically. Does it make sense? If you find that a piece of balsa wood weighs 45 tons, you might need to check for mistakes.
</ul>


<h2>When will we use this?</h2>

10. I'm glad you asked. Let's do some word problems!<br>
9. To avoid falling for misleading <a href="./pricefail.jpg">marketing</a>, <a href="./graphfail.jpg">graphs, and news.</a><br>
8. To decrease your dependence on technology. The calculator is only as smart as the user. Some areas of math will always require a human brain (such as proofs).<br>
7. Scholarships and generously-paying career fields.<br>
6. For the test, the chapter, the course, and all your future math courses. Learn to add fractions now, save yourself stress later on.<br>
5. To gain expertise; to be the one people go to for help. It takes a lot of practice to get there, but anyone can become a math expert.<br>
4. Theoretical math sometimes turns out to have surprise practical uses.<br>
3. For fun. People used to do math problems recreationally. Why not anymore? Find ways to make a game out of it.<br>
2. Numbers rule the digital world. Understanding math is crucial to understanding computers and how they affect our lives.<br>
1. <b>You will never "use" this.</b> People don't lift weights so they'll be prepared should, one day, somebody knock them over on the street and trap them under a barbell. You lift weights so that you can knock over a defensive lineman, or carry your groceries or lift your grandchildren without being sore the next day. You do math exercises so that you can improve your ability to think logically, so that you can be a better lawyer, doctor, architect, or parent. Math is mental weight training. It is a means to an end, (for most people), not an end in itself. - 9th grade algebra teacher, Dean Sherman

<h2>What is your mission?</h2>

I was aimless when I was a freshman undergraduate. I was in engineering, but after a year I still had no idea what it was about or what I wanted to do with it. Then I switched to education and stayed there and obtained a Bachelor's Degree in it, because I had a strong desire to make math make sense for as many people as possible. Do you know why you are in college? What is your mission? If you have a mission, you have motivation.<br><br>

Education ultimately is not about what I do, but about what you do. This isn't to say I have no role, but I can only teach. I cannot do your learning. Math must be done to be learned, hence assigned work. Do not expect me (or any professor) to check in on you, academically or otherwise. I will not (<a href="https://www.wichita.edu/administration/financial_aid/ferpa.php">legally I cannot</a>) talk to your parents or anyone else about your academic progress. You are responsible for doing the assigned work.<br><br>

If something is getting in the way of doing your assigned work, let me know as soon as possible so that we can resolve the problem. Many students will wait until finals week to communicate with me at all, and I always ask: "Why didn't you tell me sooner? I could have helped then, but now it's too late."<br><br>

<h2>Tests</h2>

Even with the leaps in technology, paper-and-pencil tests remain the most reliable and efficient way to evaluate everyone's individual progress in learning the objectives. I write my own tests unless otherwise noted. <br><br>

Some people will finish quicker than others, but everybody gets the whole period. There's no extra credit for speed. If someone finishes in the first 10 minutes, they might have aced it or they might have given up. Don't compare yourself to others in this regard.<br><br>

<i>"How many questions will be on the test?"</i><br><br>

A reasonable amount. Some questions are quick, others will take more work, which is why number of questions isn't the best measurement. I usually plan for 2 pages (1 front and back) per 25 minutes of class time, and if you study and pay attention, you will likely get done early. Still, test anxiety is real. If it affects you severely, consider talking to Disability Services, who can give you extended time and/or other accommodations. If you qualify, you can take tests in the Testing Center in Grace Wilkie Hall at no charge.<br><br>

<i>"How should I prepare?"</i><br><br>

<ul>
<li>Study the objectives. I write all notes, homework, reviews, and tests based on the objectives list in the syllabus. In general, do good study habits. Take breaks, eat snacks, get enough sleep. See the links section below for a site on the specifics of math study habits.<br><br>

<li>Budget all of your time. As I say at the start of the semester, the credit hour is not just a number. It indicates how much work you can expect to need to do in order to succeed. A fuller explanation of the credit hour is in the syllabus. Before the semester begins, look at your schedule. If you work full time, take a full time course load, and have family obligations, can you handle it all? Or will one or more of those areas start to suffer?<br><br>

<li>Don't cram. Cramming does not work, <i>especially</i> not in the math discipline! My math classes are not merely about memorizing facts, they are about learning and practicing processes and sharpening problem-solving skills. The problem for most students is not a lack of time, but a lack of efficiency. Studying for 12 hours solid is an extremely inefficient use of time. You will learn more in less time by studying 1 hour a day each day.<br><br>
</ul>
