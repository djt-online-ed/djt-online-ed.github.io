I love puzzles! They are the mental version of skate parks and the tricks executed there. Some strength is involved, but it's more about finesse and elegance on the part of the builder (puzzle creator) and the skater (puzzle solver).

Some free puzzle treasuries I highly recommend include the youtube channel [Cracking the Cryptic](https://www.youtube.com/CrackingTheCryptic), which features new videos of Sudoku variants (and other popular puzzles) every day. The solvers explain their thought process step by step. The logical deductions used to solve these puzzles are the same muscles used for many math problems.

More directly mathematical is the [Art of Problem Solving competitions archive](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/AMC_Problems_and_Solutions). The problems are works of art. Depending on your level you may enjoy AMC 8, 10, 12, or AIME problems.

Below are puzzles that I authored or obtained from sources I couldn't track down. If a solution is not posted and you think you have one, let me know. I may feature your solution as the official one if it is correct and elegant. Some of them have been used for our department's Problem Of The Month, which offers prizes for solutions. (see 3rd floor of Jabara Hall for information.)

|**Tangent logs:** For what exact value of $b>1$ are the graphs of $f(x)=b^x$ and $g(x)= \log_b x$ tangent to each other?|
|**Creases:** A rectangular piece of paper ABCD is creased six times: <br><br> Lengthwise and widthwise (A meets B, and A meets D) <br> Meeting of corners (A meets C, and B meets D) <br> Along the diagonal AC, and along the diagonal BD. <br> <br> All six creases are distinct. At the center of the paper, all the creases intersect, and the angles between each pair of adjacent creases are all equal. Determine the ratio of the paper's short side to its long side.|
|**Self-sum numbers:** Suppose every letter represents an integer, and that certain numbers, when spelled out in english and when their letters are added together, equal the number. For instance, S + E + V + E + N = 7. Suppose this is true for the numbers five through twenty-two inclusive, and letter values are consistent across all these numbers. (Disregard the hyphen.) In all, sixteen distinct letters show up in these numbers. Find the sum of the values of all sixteen letters.|
|**Unfolding:** <br> $a+b=3$ <br> $a^2+b^2=4$ <br> $a^3+b^3=?$ <br> $a^4+b^4=?$ <br> All the above can be done without knowing the individual values of $a$ and $b$. As a bonus, find these values.|
|**Windmill:** Find a function $\textbf{R} \to \textbf{R}$, defined everywhere, whose graph in the cartesian plane has 90 degree rotational symmetry about the origin.|
|**Palindrome Sum:** Call a positive integer a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward. (No leading zeros, so that 0330 is not a palindrome.) Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of two palindromes. 389 for instance is 383 + 6 as well as 323 + 66. What three-digit (non-palindromic) number cannot be expressed as the sum of two palindromes?|
|**Rays:** Two distinct points A and B are chosen at random in the plane. A ray is drawn in a random direction from each point. What is the probability that the two rays intersect?|
|**Here is your six digit code, expires in 10 minutes:** Find six distinct digits A,B,C,D,E,F, none of them zero, such that $A^B+C^D=E^F$.|
|**Perfection** Call a triangle "perfect" if it is a right triangle with equal perimeter and area. <br> Algebra: Find all perfect triangles with integer side lengths.<br>Trigonometry: Find a perfect triangle with an angle of 60 degrees.<br> Calculus: Find a perfect triangle with perimeter 1 and minimum area. |
|**Hug:** Circle $A$ with radius 1 is tangent to a line $l$. Two more circles each with radius $r$ are tangent to both $A$ and $l$, and one more circle with radius $r$ is tangent to all other circles. Find $r$. <br> ![](https://djt-online-ed.github.io/puzzles/hug.png)|
|**Sum = product:** $x$ , $y$ , and $c$ are real numbers such that $x+y = xy = c$. Determine the set of all possible real values for $c$. |
|**Lucky numbers:** On a lottery ticket, there are 5 distinct integers from 1 to 50 inclusive, in no particular order. Among the numbers on the ticket: <br> The first number is the only perfect square. <br> The second number is the only perfect cube. <br> The third number is the only even number. <br> The fourth number is the only prime number. <br> The fifth number is the sum of the other four numbers. <br> Determine the five numbers.|
|**Zigzag:** A sequence of points is plotted on the coordinate plane: (0,1), (2,0), (0,3), (4,0), (0,5), (6,0)... (0,2n-1), (2n,0) ... (0,999), (1000,0). Line segments are drawn between consecutive points in this sequence. (The first few line segments are shown in the figure.) These line segments, along with the positive x- and y-axes, partition some of the first quadrant into triangles. "Proper" triangles are ones which contain no line segments in their interior. The proper triangles which border the x-axis are colored black, and the remaining proper triangles are colored gold. Find the ratio of the total area of the gold triangles to the total area of the black triangles. <br> ![](https://djt-online-ed.github.io/puzzles/201808img.png)|
|**Exoplanet:** A planet orbits a binary star system. The two stars have the same orbit around the center of mass, orbit at the same speed, and remain at opposite endpoints throughout their 80 day year. (i.e., the stars take 80 days to revolve around each other, thus 40 days to switch places.) The planet's year is 360 days. How many times will the stars eclipse themselves (relative to the planet) during the planet's year? <br> ![](https://djt-online-ed.github.io/puzzles/201709img.png)|
|**Unique tiles:** Square tiles are divided into eight regions as seen below. Any of the eight regions may be either white or black. How many possible distinct tiles are there? Reflections are considered distinct, but rotations are not. (These tiles form the basis for the board game Izzi. <br> ![](https://djt-online-ed.github.io/puzzles/201708img.png)|
|**Trick:** A standard deck of 52 cards is shuffled thoroughly and dealt face up randomly in a 4 row by 13 column grid arrangement. You are allowed to take each of the 4 rows in turn and rearrange the cards in that row in any order. Then you are allowed to take each of the 13 columns in turn and rearrange the cards in that column in any order, and make no further changes. Call the grid "solved" if all cards in each row have equal suit and all cards in each column have equal rank. What is the probability that it's possible to solve the grid in the way described?|
|**Bracket:** Five contestants run a series of races in which there are no ties. The finishing order is recorded and the last-place finisher is eliminated. The remaining players race again. This continues until one runner remains. Below is a valid series result for runners labeled A,B,C,D,E, listed in order of finish: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th.<br><br>Valid bracket:<br>Race 1 : B, C, A, E, D <br>Race 2 : C, E, B, A <br>Race 3 : B, E, C<br>Race 4 : E, B<br><br>Invalid bracket:<br>Race 1 : D, D, A, E, A <br>Race 2 : B, C, B, A<br>Race 3 : E, A, D<br>Race 4 : D, B<br><br>If the fourteen positions are each filled randomly with a letter chosen from A-E (each with equal probability), we get invalid results as above, in which a runner takes multiple places in a race, and eliminated runners continue to compete. What is the probability that a randomly filled bracket is valid? Give an exact compact form, then an approximation.|
|**Cat's cradle:** Lines $l_1$,  $l_2$, and $l_3$ are parallel, with $l_2$ between $l_1$ and $l_3$. Points $X,Y,Z$ lie on $l_2$, with $Y$ between $X$ and $Z$. Point $A$ lies on $l_1$. Extend $AX$ to meet $l_3$ at $B$, $BY$ to meet $l_1$ at $C$, $CZ$ to meet $l_3$ at $D$, $DX$ to meet $l_1$ at $E$, $EY$ to meet $l_3$ at $F$. Prove that $FZ$ extends to meet $l_1$ at $A$. <br> ![](https://djt-online-ed.github.io/puzzles/202411img.png)|
|**Sphube:** A sphere and a cube share a center, and the surface of the sphere passes through the midpoints of the cubeâ€™s edges. Looking at the union of the solids, find the ratio of the visible surface area of the sphere to the visible surface area of the cube.|
|**Power tower:** If $3^{12^x} = 12^{3^x}$, find $9^{4^x}$. |
|**Equilaterals:** Three squares of side length 1 are arranged so that their diagonals form an equilateral triangle. Find the side length of the small equilateral hexagon formed by the intersection of all three squares.|
