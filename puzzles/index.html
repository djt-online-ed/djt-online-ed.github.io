	I love puzzles! They are the mental version of skate parks and the tricks executed there. Some strength is involved, but it's more about finesse and elegance on the part of the builder (puzzle creator) and the skater (puzzle solver). <br>
	Some free puzzle treasuries I highly recommend include the youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/CrackingTheCryptic">Cracking the Cryptic</a>, which features new videos of Sudoku variants (and other popular puzzles) every day. The creators explain their thought process step by step. The logical deductions used to solve these puzzles are the same muscles used for many math problems.<br>
	More directly mathematical is <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/AMC_Problems_and_Solutions">Art of Problem Solving</a>, which holds competitions at all levels. The problems are works of art. Depending on your level you may enjoy AMC 8, 10, 12, or AIME problems.<br>
	Below are puzzles that I authored or obtained from sources I couldn't track down. If a solution is not posted and you think you have one, let me know. I may feature your solution as the official one if it is correct and elegant.<br><br>

				<b>Palindrome Sum</b><br>
				Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of two palindromes. 389 for instance is 383 + 6 as well as 323 + 66.<br>
				What three-digit (non-palindromic) number cannot be expressed as the sum of two palindromes?<br>
				(Palindromes with leading zeroes [like 030 and 0550] are not allowed, and neither are negative numbers or non-integers.)<br>

				<b>Rays</b><br>
				Two distinct points A and B are chosen at random in the plane. A ray is drawn in a random direction from each point. What is the probability that the two rays intersect?<br>

				<b>Hug</b><br>
				Circle \( A \) with radius 1 is tangent to a line \( l \). Two more circles each with radius \( r \) are tangent to both \( A \) and \( l \), and one more circle with radius \( r \) is tangent to all other circles. Find \( r \). <br>

				<b>Perfection</b><br>
				Call a triangle "perfect" if it is a right triangle with equal perimeter and area.<br>
				<b>Algebra:</b> Find all perfect triangles with integer side lengths.<br>

				<b>Calculus:</b> Find a perfect triangle with perimeter 1 and minimum area.<br>

				All the above can be done without knowing the individual values of \( a \) and \( b \). As a bonus, find these values.<br>

			<br>On a lottery ticket, there are 5 distinct integers from 1 to 50 inclusive, in no particular order. Among the numbers on the ticket:<br><br>
				The first number is the only perfect square.<br>
				The second number is the only perfect cube.<br>
				The third number is the only even number.<br>
				The fourth number is the only prime number.<br>
				The fifth number is the sum of the other four numbers.<br><br>
				Determine the five numbers.<br>

			<b>Zigzag</b><br>
			A sequence of points is plotted on the coordinate plane: (0,1), (2,0), (0,3), (4,0), (0,5), (6,0)... (0,2n-1), (2n,0) ... (0,999), (1000,0). Line segments are drawn between consecutive points in this sequence. (The first few line segments are shown in the figure.) These line segments, along with the positive x- and y-axes, partition some of the first quadrant into triangles. "Proper" triangles are ones which contain no line segments in their interior. The proper triangles which border the x-axis are colored black, and the remaining proper triangles are colored gold. Find the ratio of the total area of the gold triangles to the total area of the black triangles. <br>

				<li>Along the diagonal AC, and along the diagonal BD.</li>

			<b>Self-sum numbers</b><br>
			Suppose every letter represents an integer, and that certain numbers, when spelled out in english and when their letters are added together, equal the number. For instance, S + E + V + E + N = 7. Suppose this is true for the numbers <b>five through twenty-two inclusive, and letter values are consistent across all these numbers.</b> (Disregard the hyphen.)<br>

			<b>Exoplanet</b><br>
			A planet orbits a binary star system. The two stars have the same orbit around the center of mass, orbit at the same speed, and remain at opposite endpoints throughout their 80 day year. (i.e., the stars take 80 days to revolve around each other, thus 40 days to switch places.) The planet's year is 360 days. How many times will the stars eclipse themselves (relative to the planet) during the planet's year?<br>

			<b>Robot range</b><br>
			A square room is 20 meters on a side. A robot starts in one corner and travels in a straight line to the center of the room. From there, it does the following repeatedly: Turns 90 degrees clockwise, then travels half the distance it traveled previously. It repeats these steps indefinitely, but it takes a finite amount of time, and the robot stops on a point. What is the distance between the robot's final position and the farthest corner of the room from the robot?<br>
