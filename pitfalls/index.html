<h1 align="center">Common pitfalls</h1>

<h2 id="simplify">When to simplify</h2>

When books ask us to "simplify" an expression, they usually mean to get it in as small a form as possible, one that requires little writing but still conveys the same value. For the most part this is correct. However, "simple" can be somewhat relative. Take for instance the following equivalent expressions. Which form is "simpler"? It will depend on the problem or purpose.<br>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td colspan=2 align="center"> \( 5 \dfrac{1}{3} \hspace{2cm} = \hspace{2cm} \dfrac{16}{3} \) </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width=50%> The mixed form \( 5 \frac{1}{3} \) is familiar and has the advantage of easily communicating where this number is compared to other numbers on the number line, and contains all important information about the division that led to it. The problem is that in algebra, adjacency usually implies multiplication, which makes this form ambiguous. Do we mean \( 5 + \frac{1}{3} \) or \( 5 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \)?<br>
		</td>
		<td>
		What is often called "improper" form is actually "proper" in that it is preferred for algebra and all math classes afterwards. It avoids the confusion mentioned, and allows us to more easily do certain arithmetic / algebraic operations such as evaluating \( \frac{16}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{8} \).
		</td>
	</tr>


	<tr>
		<td colspan=2 align="center"> \( \sqrt{2} \hspace{2cm} \approx \hspace{2cm} 1.4142135 \) </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> \( \sqrt{2} \) saves a lot of writing and is a perfectly exact representation of "the number you square to get 2". The square root of 2 is irrational so it has a decimal expansion that neither terminates nor repeats. No human can write, and no calculator can store, enough decimal places to give us the true value of \( \sqrt{2} \). <br>
		</td>
		<td>
		1.4142135 is a very good approximation, gives us an idea of where this number is compared to other numbers on the number line, and is needed for practical measurements. Its square, though, is 1.99999982358225, which is very close but not equal to 2. Every approximation introduces roundoff error.

	</tr>


	<tr>
		<td colspan=2 align="center"> \( (x+1)^4 \hspace{2cm} = \hspace{2cm} x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1 \) </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>  \( (x+1)^4 \) is simpler when considering solving \( (x+1)^4 = 16 \), or reducing \( \frac{(x+3)(x+1)}{(x+1)^4} \). It is also the only acceptable answer if we are given \( x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1 \) and we are explicitly asked to factor it.
		</td>
		<td>
		\( x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1 \) is simpler when investigating polynomial properties, such as end behavior. It is also the only acceptable answer if we are given \( (x+1)^4 \) and we are explicitly asked to expand it.

<br>
<i>"So how far should I simplify on a test?"</i><br>
<br>
Here is what you should be able to do easily without a calculator. I take off point(s) if these are not done, or done incorrectly:<br>
<ul>
<li>Do all arithmetic. If your answer consists only of numbers, add/subtract/multiply/divide down to  a single number. Evaluate all exponents; \( (-4)^3 \) should be written as -64.</li>
<li>If there is uneven division, always convert fractions to improper form, never mixed form! See above. 
<li>Decimal form is acceptable if the fraction results in terminating decimals. If the answer was 41/20, I would also accept 2.05. If the answer was 5/3 and you wanted to write it as a decimal, I would only accept \( 1.\bar{6} \)  (with the repeating bar!) This is why 5/3 is preferred; it's short, exact, can be done without a calculator, and usually easier to work with on the way to the answer.</li>
<li>Only round/approximate the FINAL answer, not any numbers in between. If we round off in the middle of calculations, the error introduced is carried forward and may affect the final answer drastically. For instance, with function \(f(x) = x^{10} \), the difference between 1.41 and 1.414 is small, but the difference between the output values is nearly 1: \( 1.41^{10} = 31.059261594 \), and \( 1.414^{10} = 31.951709176 \)
</li>
<li>I will not ask you to do anything by hand that requires a calculator. I may ask you to simplify \( \sqrt{12} \) to get \( 2 \sqrt{3} \), but you will never need to work out a decimal approximation of either one of these by hand.</li>
<li>In the end, if you're not sure, first read the instructions. If still stuck, ask me. During a test I can answer questions about instructions or answer format.</li> 
</ul>


<h2 id="distribute">(λ) When to distribute</h2>

As soon as you learn the distributive property, there is the impulse to distribute everything! Sometimes this instinct is correct but not always. Knowing when to distribute can be the difference between 1 point and full points on a problem.<br><br>

In the order of operations, <b>Powers (and roots)</b> come before <b>Multiplying (and dividing)</b> which come before <b>Adding (and subtracting)</b>. An operation in this chain distributes over the operation immediately after it, but no further.<br><br>

		<td> Multiplying or dividing a group by a number? This distributes over addition and subtraction. Multiplying/dividing is one level above adding and subtracting. <br> It's worth noting here that denominators do not "split" in this way, that is, \( \dfrac{a}{n+m} \neq \dfrac{a}{n} + \dfrac{a}{m} \) ! To see why, remember that division is just a kind of multiplication. \( \dfrac{a+b}{n} \) works because it is equal to \( (a+b)\frac{1}{n} \), while \( \dfrac{a}{n+m} \) becomes \( a \frac{1}{n+m} \) and there is nothing to distribute.

		<td align="center">

		<td>
			However, powers and roots do NOT distribute over sums and differences! These operations are too far removed. You can prove this to yourself by a counterexample: Is it true that \( (3+5)^2 = 3^2 + 5^2 \) ? Or that \( \sqrt{16+9} = \sqrt{16} + \sqrt{9} \)? This is the most frequent algebra mistake I see. Even calculus students make this error sometimes!

			Okay, so if all this is wrong, what's the right way? Squares don't distribute over sums, but do they at least do something? Yes. Take these formulas and write them down, get tattoos of them, whatever it takes for you to remember these. They are worth memorizing because they are two of the most common operations. But they are specific to squares only. There's analogous formulas for cubes and up, but they do not look exactly the same.<br>

<h2 id="cancel">(Φ) When to cancel</h2>

Another frequent algebra mistake I see is in canceling, specifically, the reducing of a rational expression. The rule of thumb here is: <b>You can cancel factors, not terms.</b><br><br>

Terms are parts of an expression separated by + and -. A rational expression is one giant division. Division does not undo addition or subtraction. Division only undoes multiplication. Therefore we need to write our expressions as products, or factor them, as completely as possible. The components of the product are called factors. This applies to ordinary fractions and algebra.<br><br>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td> \( \dfrac{21}{28} \) </td>
		<td> Goal: Simplify this fraction to lowest terms. I hope that we wouldn't think of crossing out 2's!</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> \( \dfrac{7 \cdot 3}{7 \cdot 2^2} \) </td>
		<td> We factor as thoroughly as possible, down to the prime factors. </td>
	</tr>
		<td> \( \dfrac{3}{4} \) </td>
`		<td> 7 is a common factor in the numerator and denominator and therefore can be canceled. We are done. </td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td> \( \dfrac{x^2-6x+5}{x^2-25} \) </td>
		<td> Goal: Simplify this rational expression to lowest terms. Initially this expression is unfactored, so resist all temptation to start crossing things out! \( x^2 \) is a term of each of the numerator and denominator, but not a factor. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> \( \dfrac{(x-5)(x-1)}{(x-5)(x+5)} \) </td>
		<td> Here is the same expression after the numerator and denominator are each factored, written as products. Since division undoes multiplication, (x-5) can be cancelled from the numerator and denominator. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> \( \dfrac{x-1}{x+5} \) </td>
		<td> We are done. Resist once again the temptation to cross out x's! <b>(x-1) and (x+5) are factors</b> of this and the previous expression's numerator and denominator respectively, while <b>x and 1 and 5 are terms</b> and cannot cancel. </td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h2 id="zero">(ζ) Zero-Product Property</h2>
If it's known that the product of two numbers is zero, what can be known about the numbers? A bit of thinking should lead us to the answer: at least one of the numbers must be zero. Or: If \(ab = 0 \), then \( a=0 \) or \( b=0 \). 
This is called the zero-product property because zero is the ONLY product for which this property holds.<br><br>

We could try other numbers to see this. For instance, if two numbers have a product of 15, is it necessarily true that one of the numbers must be 15? Well, \( 3 \cdot 5 \) are two numbers that multiply to 15, but neither one itself is 15. So if all we know is that \( ab = 15 \), we have no useful information about \( a \) or \( b \).<br><br>

Suppose we are trying to solve the equation \( 8x - x^2 = 15 \).<br><br>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td bgcolor="FF9999">
			\( x(8-x) = 15 \) <br><br>
			This first step leads us immediately down a bad path! The product of x and (x-8) being 15 tells us nothing useful about x or (8-x).<br><br>
			\( x = 15 \) or \( 8 - x = 15 \)<br><br>
			\( x = 15 \) or \( x = -7 \)<br><br>
			Neither of these answers check.
		</td>
		<td>
			\( - x^2 + 8x - 15 = 0 \)<br>
			\( x^2 - 8x + 15 = 0 \)<br><br>
			Solving quadratic equations is standardized. Manipulate everything to one side and we can use factoring or other methods on this common form.<br><br>
			\( (x-5)(x-3) = 0 \)<br><br>
			Since this amounts to saying a product of two things is zero, we can say for certain that one of those objects must be zero.<br><br>
			\( x-5=0 \) or \( x-3=0 \)<br><br>
			\( x=5 \) or \( x=3 \)<br><br>
			Both of these answers check.
		</td>
</table>

<h2 id="cross">When to cross-multiply (almost never)</h2>

There is only ONE situation which “cross multiplication” is designed for: Solving equations of the form \( \dfrac{A}{B} = \dfrac{C}{D} \).<br> This results in \( AD = BC \), and from there we can solve as usual. Cross multiplication CANNOT be used to add, subtract, multiply, or divide fractions, or anything else -- it was never designed for those situations.<br>
In fact, it only saves one step. If you're learning algebra for the first time, it's better to simply multiply both sides by one denominator, followed by the other.

<h2 id="calc">Calculus: Operators</h2>

The big three operations that Calc I focuses on are limits, derivatives, and integrals. The latter two are what are called 'operators' and for our purposes we will consider the first to be of this same kind. The main mistake I see in calculus, as well as in the above trigonometric errors, is that <b>a function or operator is not being treated like one,</b> but is instead tossed around like a variable. It can be easy to do this since they're all made of letters and symbols, but there is a hierarchy of "strength" among these:<br><br>

<b>Operators</b> such as \( \lim \), \( \dfrac{d}{dx} \), and \( \int \), operate on <br>
<b>functions,</b> such as \(f\) and \(g\), which operate on <br>
<b>variables</b>, such as \(x\), \(t\), and \( \theta \). <br><br>

In this way, operators are not unlike functions; they have in common with functions that they require inputs and produce outputs -- but usually those inputs and outputs are functions themselves.<br><br>

Sometimes an operator is "Linear". \( L \) is a linear operator if, for any constant c and any real numbers x,y, we have \( L(cx) = cL(x) \) and \( L(x+y) = L(x) + L(y) \). In other words, linear operators distribute over or "respect" sums and differences, and constant multiples can float in and out of L.<br><br>
Any other properties of L are possible but not guaranteed. We cannot say in general that \( L(xy) = L(x) \cdot L(y) \), for instance. This is true of limits, but not derivatives or integrals.<br><br>


<h2 id="log">Logarithms</h2>

Logarithms lurk at the end of every algebra course, swamped in a new notation, usually skipped by the teacher and ignored/feared by the students. But these creatures are quite tame. I highly recommend this video by Vihart called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-7tcTIrers">How I feel about logarithms</a>, a 10-minute and artful explanation of the topic. Below I explain why we need them in the first place.<br><br>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
Addition is commutative. In other words, the solution to<br>
\(x + 2 = 9 \)<br>
is the same as the solution to<br>
\( 2 + x = 9 \). <br>
In both cases, the key is to subtract an appropriate number from both sides. Subtraction is the inverse of addition.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
Multiplication is also commutative. The solution to <br>
\( 2x = 9 \) <br>
is the same as the solution to <br>
\( x2 = 9 \) <br>
although it is not standard to write it as such. In both cases, the key is to divide the appropriate number on both sides. Division is the inverse of multiplication.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
However, exponentiation is NOT commutative. That is, the solution to <br>
\( x^2 = 9 \) <br>
is NOT the same as the solution to <br>
\( 2^x = 9. \)<br>
In the first case, we must take a square root. In the second case, we should take... an xth root? But it's not helpful in figuring out what x is. This is what logarithms are designed to do. We take a "log base 2" of both sides to get \( \log_2 (2^x) = \log_2 (9) \) and therefore \( x = \log_2 9 \).
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
But even though exponentiation is not commutative, there is still a beautiful symmetry between roots, powers, and logarithms. I learned of this structure, called the Triangle of Power, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sULa9Lc4pck">from this video.</a> In the picture below, the spatial relationship between these three numbers closely matches the three notations used to express the relationship.<br><br>

<table align = "center"> 
	<tr>
		<td colspan="3" align="center"> \( 3 \) <br> \( 2 \Huge \Delta \normalsize 8 \) </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> Power </td>
		<td> Root </td>
		<td> Logarithm </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> \( 2^3 = 8 \)</td>
		<td> \( 2 = \sqrt[3]{8} \) </td>
		<td align="center"> \( 3 = \) <br> ...<br> \( \log_2 8 \)</td> 
	</tr> 
</table>
<br>
So if we're stuck with evaluating a logarithm and would rather turn it into a question in the form of a power or root, simply build a triangle and fill in the known values. Then solve for the missing number any way you like.



<h2 id="proof">Patterns versus Proofs</h2>

Mathematics is largely about a search for patterns and codifying them. We are trained to look for patterns and make predictions, and this is a good thing! But we must be careful not to mistake our predictions for proofs.<br><br>

Suppose we choose \( n \) points on a circle and draw all chords joining those points (choosing the points such that no three chords meet at the same point.) How many regions does this divide the circle into?<br><br>

<table align = "center"> 
	<tr><td><img src="./pvp1.png"></td></tr>
</table>

Based on the first few trials, we might reasonably guess that the number of regions doubles with each new point. Or, \( n \) points divides the circle into \( 2^{n-1} \) regions. This is a conjecture, a use of inductive reasoning. It can be tested.<br><br>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td align = "center">
		Even n=5 satisfies this pattern.<br>
		<img src="./pvp2.png" width="80%">
		</td>
		<td align = "center">
		But when n=6...<br>
		<img src="./pvp3.png" width="80%">
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
...The pattern is broken and our conjecture is proven false. If we had stopped at \( n=5 \), we would have come up with a faulty formula for the number of regions! This is why we must always seek to prove our assumptions before we rely on them. A formula does exist for this problem, <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircleDivisionbyChords.html ">and can be found here.</a>
<br><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOCsdhzo6Jg">There is also a great song about this pattern.</a>
